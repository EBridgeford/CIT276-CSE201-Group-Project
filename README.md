===========================

Group Project

You can DL a GUI interface for uploading commits/syncing files/ and whatnot 
at https://windows.github.com/ or https://mac.github.com/ or there is a mac video tutorial at 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE which walks mac user's through commandline interaction
However the commands wouldn't work on windows for me But I'll keep looking.  (Patrick Scott Hadley)
